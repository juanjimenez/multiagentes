  abstract      = {This paper addresses the formation maneuver control problem of leader-follower multi-agent systems with high-order integrator dynamics. A distributed output feedback formation maneuver controller is proposed to achieve desired maneuvers so that the scale, orientation, translation, and shape of formation can be manipulated continuously, where the followers do not need to know or estimate the time-varying maneuver parameters only known to the leaders. Compared with existing relative-measurement-based formation maneuver control, the advantages of the proposed method are that it is output (relative output) feedback based and shows how to realize different types of formation shape. In addition, it can be applied to non-generic and non-convex nominal configurations and the leaders are allowed to be maneuvered. It is worth noting that the proposed method can also be extended to general linear multi-agent systems under some additional conditions. The theoretical results are demonstrated by a simulation example.},

  abstract      = {This paper studies distributed maneuver control of multi-agent formations in arbitrary dimensions. The objective is to control the translation and scale of the formation while maintaining the desired formation pattern. Unlike conventional approaches where the target formation is defined by relative positions or distances, we propose a novel bearing-based approach where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings. Since the bearings are invariant to the translation and scale of the formation, the bearing-based approach provides a simple solution to the problem of translational and scaling formation maneuver control. Linear formation control laws for double-integrator dynamics are proposed and the global formation stability is analyzed. This paper also studies bearing-based formation control in the presence of practical problems including input disturbances, acceleration saturation, and collision avoidance. The theoretical results are illustrated with numerical simulations.},

  __markedentry = {[juan:6]},
  abstract      = {This paper is concerned with bearing-based cooperative target entrapping control of multiple uncertain agents with arbitrary maneuvers including shape deformation, rotations, scalings, etc. A leader-follower structure is used, where the leaders move with the predesigned trajectories, and the followers are steered by an estimation-based control method, integrating a distance estimator using bearing measurements and a stress matrix-based formation controller. The signum functions are used to compensate for the uncertainties so that the agents' accelerations can be piecewise continuous and bounded to track the desired dynamics. With proper design of the leaders' trajectories and a geometric configuration, an affine matrix is determined so that the persistently exciting conditions of the inter-agent relative bearings can be satisfied since the bearing rates are related to different weighted combinations of the affine matrix vectors. The asymptotic convergence of the estimation error and control error is proved using Filipov properties and cascaded system theories. A sufficient condition for inter-agent collision avoidance is also proposed. Finally, simulation results are given to validate the effectiveness of the method in both 2D and 3D cases.},

  abstract      = {This paper proposes a port-Hamiltonian framework for angle-based formation stabilization and maneuvers using bearing and velocity measurements with an underlying triangulated Laman graph. The corresponding port-Hamiltonian controller is designed using virtual couplings on the errors of angle constraints in angle space and then the angle constraints and agent actuators are mapped by the constraint Jacobian, which can be applied to other formation constraints. In addition, due to the fact that the port-Hamiltonian model allows for complex and heterogeneous agent dynamics, our framework can be extended to networks with different agent dynamics and formation constraints. To avoid unavailable distance terms in the control law, an estimator is designed based on port-Hamiltonian theory and the property that energy is coordinate-free for different sensor modalities using bearing and velocity measurements, which permits our framework to inject damping for the formation maneuvers. Furthermore, several maneuvers are analyzed under both considerations of stabilization and transient performance. Simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

Due to the invariance of the bearings, the bearing-based approach provides a natural solution to formation scale control. We assume the dynamics of each agent as a single integrator and propose a globally stable proportional-integral formation maneuver control law. It is shown that at least two leaders are required to collaborate in order to control the centroid and scale of the formation whereas the followers are not required to have access to any global information, such as the velocities of the leaders.},

  __markedentry = {[juan:6]},
  abstract      = {Vehicle platoon often face the problem of lack of scalability of maneuvers in practical applications. Once a new scenario is added, the original program may no longer be available. To deal with this problem, this paper introduces a two-dimensional maneuver management framework with a fault-tolerant mechanism on the basis of the proposed hierarchical architecture for the platoon control system. Maneuvers and roles are two dimensions, based on which the management strategies are decoupled. This makes each vehicle in the platoon has the ability to execute management strategies of various maneuvers and the new maneuver could be extended without revising the existing part. The fault-tolerant mechanism is designed as a maneuver triggered by hardware failures to keep safe before taking over. Furthermore, three typical maneuvers are selected for case studies to illustrate how the management strategies in this framework work. Finally, a comprehensive simulation scenario integrating different maneuvers is designed and a real-world implementation using micro-vehicles is conducted. Results show that the propose two-dimensional framework could effectively deal with various maneuvers and satisfy the computational real-time requirements},

  title         = {Learning Extreme Hummingbird Maneuvers on Flapping Wing Robots},
  __markedentry = {[juan:6]},
  abstract      = {Biological studies show that hummingbirds can perform extreme aerobatic maneuvers during fast escape. Given a sudden looming visual stimulus at hover, a hummingbird initiates a fast backward translation coupled with a 180-degree yaw turn, which is followed by instant posture stabilization in just under 10 wingbeats. Consider the wingbeat frequency of 40Hz, this aggressive maneuver is carried out in just 0.2 seconds. Inspired by the hummingbirds' near-maximal performance during such extreme maneuvers, we developed a flight control strategy and experimentally demonstrated that such maneuverability can be achieved by an at-scale 12-gram hummingbird robot equipped with just two actuators. The proposed hybrid control policy combines model-based nonlinear control with model-free reinforcement learning. We use model-based nonlinear control for nominal flight control, as the dynamic model is relatively accurate for these conditions. However, during extreme maneuver, the modeling error becomes unmanageable. A model-free reinforcement learning policy trained in simulation was optimized to 'destabilize' the system and maximize the performance during maneuvering. The hybrid policy manifests a maneuver that is close to that observed in hummingbirds. Direct simulation-to-real transfer is achieved, demonstrating the hummingbird-like fast evasive maneuvers on the at-scale hummingbird robot.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we first propose a novel maneuvering technique compatible with displacement-consensus-based formation controllers. We show that the formation can be translated with an arbitrary velocity by modifying the weights in the consensus Laplacian matrix. In fact, we demonstrate that the displacement-consensus-based formation control is a particular case of our more general method. We then uncover robustness issues with undesired steady-state motions and resultant distorted shapes in undirected displacement-consensus-based formation control. In particular, these issues are triggered when neighboring agents mismeasure their relative positions, e.g., their onboard sensors are misaligned and have different scale factors. We will show that if all the sensing is close to perfect but different among the agents, then the stability of the system is compromised. Explicit expressions for the eventual non-desired velocity and shape's distortion are given as functions of the scale factors and misalignments for formations based on tree graphs.},

Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed formation control scheme can handle formation maneuvering, scaling, and orientation specifications simultaneously. Additionally, the proposed control law is implementable in agents' arbitrarily oriented local coordinate frames using only low-cost onboard vision sensors, which are favorable for practical applications.
