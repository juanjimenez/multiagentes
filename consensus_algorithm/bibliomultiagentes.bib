  title       = {Distributed Semi-global Output Feedback Formation Maneuver Control of High-order Multi-agent Systems},
  abstract    = {This paper addresses the formation maneuver control problem of leader-follower multi-agent systems with high-order integrator dynamics. A distributed output feedback formation maneuver controller is proposed to achieve desired maneuvers so that the scale, orientation, translation, and shape of formation can be manipulated continuously, where the followers do not need to know or estimate the time-varying maneuver parameters only known to the leaders. Compared with existing relative-measurement-based formation maneuver control, the advantages of the proposed method are that it is output (relative output) feedback based and shows how to realize different types of formation shape. In addition, it can be applied to non-generic and non-convex nominal configurations and the leaders are allowed to be maneuvered. It is worth noting that the proposed method can also be extended to general linear multi-agent systems under some additional conditions. The theoretical results are demonstrated by a simulation example.},

  abstract    = {This paper studies distributed maneuver control of multi-agent formations in arbitrary dimensions. The objective is to control the translation and scale of the formation while maintaining the desired formation pattern. Unlike conventional approaches where the target formation is defined by relative positions or distances, we propose a novel bearing-based approach where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings. Since the bearings are invariant to the translation and scale of the formation, the bearing-based approach provides a simple solution to the problem of translational and scaling formation maneuver control. Linear formation control laws for double-integrator dynamics are proposed and the global formation stability is analyzed. This paper also studies bearing-based formation control in the presence of practical problems including input disturbances, acceleration saturation, and collision avoidance. The theoretical results are illustrated with numerical simulations.},

  abstract    = {This paper is concerned with bearing-based cooperative target entrapping control of multiple uncertain agents with arbitrary maneuvers including shape deformation, rotations, scalings, etc. A leader-follower structure is used, where the leaders move with the predesigned trajectories, and the followers are steered by an estimation-based control method, integrating a distance estimator using bearing measurements and a stress matrix-based formation controller. The signum functions are used to compensate for the uncertainties so that the agents' accelerations can be piecewise continuous and bounded to track the desired dynamics. With proper design of the leaders' trajectories and a geometric configuration, an affine matrix is determined so that the persistently exciting conditions of the inter-agent relative bearings can be satisfied since the bearing rates are related to different weighted combinations of the affine matrix vectors. The asymptotic convergence of the estimation error and control error is proved using Filipov properties and cascaded system theories. A sufficient condition for inter-agent collision avoidance is also proposed. Finally, simulation results are given to validate the effectiveness of the method in both 2D and 3D cases.},

  abstract    = {This paper proposes a port-Hamiltonian framework for angle-based formation stabilization and maneuvers using bearing and velocity measurements with an underlying triangulated Laman graph. The corresponding port-Hamiltonian controller is designed using virtual couplings on the errors of angle constraints in angle space and then the angle constraints and agent actuators are mapped by the constraint Jacobian, which can be applied to other formation constraints. In addition, due to the fact that the port-Hamiltonian model allows for complex and heterogeneous agent dynamics, our framework can be extended to networks with different agent dynamics and formation constraints. To avoid unavailable distance terms in the control law, an estimator is designed based on port-Hamiltonian theory and the property that energy is coordinate-free for different sensor modalities using bearing and velocity measurements, which permits our framework to inject damping for the formation maneuvers. Furthermore, several maneuvers are analyzed under both considerations of stabilization and transient performance. Simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract    = {Vehicle platoon often face the problem of lack of scalability of maneuvers in practical applications. Once a new scenario is added, the original program may no longer be available. To deal with this problem, this paper introduces a two-dimensional maneuver management framework with a fault-tolerant mechanism on the basis of the proposed hierarchical architecture for the platoon control system. Maneuvers and roles are two dimensions, based on which the management strategies are decoupled. This makes each vehicle in the platoon has the ability to execute management strategies of various maneuvers and the new maneuver could be extended without revising the existing part. The fault-tolerant mechanism is designed as a maneuver triggered by hardware failures to keep safe before taking over. Furthermore, three typical maneuvers are selected for case studies to illustrate how the management strategies in this framework work. Finally, a comprehensive simulation scenario integrating different maneuvers is designed and a real-world implementation using micro-vehicles is conducted. Results show that the propose two-dimensional framework could effectively deal with various maneuvers and satisfy the computational real-time requirements},

  title       = {Learning Extreme Hummingbird Maneuvers on Flapping Wing Robots},
  abstract    = {Biological studies show that hummingbirds can perform extreme aerobatic maneuvers during fast escape. Given a sudden looming visual stimulus at hover, a hummingbird initiates a fast backward translation coupled with a 180-degree yaw turn, which is followed by instant posture stabilization in just under 10 wingbeats. Consider the wingbeat frequency of 40Hz, this aggressive maneuver is carried out in just 0.2 seconds. Inspired by the hummingbirds' near-maximal performance during such extreme maneuvers, we developed a flight control strategy and experimentally demonstrated that such maneuverability can be achieved by an at-scale 12-gram hummingbird robot equipped with just two actuators. The proposed hybrid control policy combines model-based nonlinear control with model-free reinforcement learning. We use model-based nonlinear control for nominal flight control, as the dynamic model is relatively accurate for these conditions. However, during extreme maneuver, the modeling error becomes unmanageable. A model-free reinforcement learning policy trained in simulation was optimized to 'destabilize' the system and maximize the performance during maneuvering. The hybrid policy manifests a maneuver that is close to that observed in hummingbirds. Direct simulation-to-real transfer is achieved, demonstrating the hummingbird-like fast evasive maneuvers on the at-scale hummingbird robot.},

We show that the formation can be translated with an arbitrary velocity by modifying the weights in the consensus Laplacian matrix. In fact, we demonstrate that the displacement-consensus-based formation control is a particular case of our more general method. We then uncover robustness issues with undesired steady-state motions and resultant distorted shapes in undirected displacement-consensus-based formation control. In particular, these issues are triggered when neighboring agents mismeasure their relative positions, e.g., their onboard sensors are misaligned and have different scale factors. We will show that if all the sensing is close to perfect but different among the agents, then the stability of the system is compromised. Explicit expressions for the eventual non-desired velocity and shape's distortion are given as functions of the scale factors and misalignments for formations based on tree graphs.},

Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed formation control scheme can handle formation maneuvering, scaling, and orientation specifications simultaneously. Additionally, the proposed control law is implementable in agents' arbitrarily oriented local coordinate frames using only low-cost onboard vision sensors, which are favorable for practical applications.

Meanwhile, it brings high computational complexity in deciding AME mode. In this paper, a fast affine motion estimation algorithm based on Motion Vector Difference (MVD) is proposed to solve this problem. Through the statistical analysis, it is observed that there exists notable correlation between the MVD value of the current CU and the skipping affine mode. Therefore, one metric based on MVD of TME (Translational Motion Estimation) is defined to guide the decision of skipping affine mode, which is also used to help SKIP type coding block to skip affine mode, where SKIP type coding block means that its parent CU or neighboring CU is Skip mode in this algorithm. The other metric based on CPMVD (Control Point Motion Vector Difference) of four parameter affine model is defined to skip only six parameter affine mode. The experimental results show that compared with VTM10.0, the total time complexity of the proposed algorithm in Random Access (RA) mode is reduced by 9.77%, the total affine motion estimation time complexity is reduced by 40.65%, and the BDBR coding loss is only 0.07%. In Low Delay B (LDB) mode, the total coding time is reduced by 18.64%, the total affine motion estimation time is reduced by 51.54%, and the BD-BR coding loss is only 0.22%.},

If the motion in formation is properly organized, many advantages over traditional systems can be obtained: system cost can be reduced, system reliability and efficiency can be increased, while ensuring the reconfigurability and flexibility of the system's structure.Movement while maintaining a certain geometric structure has a wide range of applications. For example, in military missions, autonomous vehicles must maintain a certain structure of formation to cover terrain and conduct reconnaissance; in Smart Highway systems, the capacity of the transportation network can be greatly increased if vehicles can be grouped together at the same speed while maintaining a certain distance between them.This paper provides an algorithm for movement with a certain geometric structure of a group of autonomous mobile robots.},

The proposed technique allows a rich collection of collective motions such as rotations around the centroid, translations, scalings, and shearings of a reference shape. These motions can be applied in useful collective behaviors such as shaped consensus (the rendezvous with a particular shape), escorting one of the team agents, or area coverage.

In this case, a long-term performance index is created to track the MASs tracking faults using a leader-follower structure. In order to approximate the ideal solution, which is challenging to find for systems vulnerable to cyberattacks during time-varying maneuvers, a critical neural network is used. The distributed control protocol is obtained, and the long-term performance index is minimized, using an actor neural network strengthened with critic signals. The actor-critic neural networks calculate unknown dynamics and the severity of attacks on the MAS actuators. The Nussbaum functions are applied to address this issue since attacks can result in a loss of control direction. The stability of the closed-loop system has been emphasized with the use of a Lyapunov candidate function. The performance of the suggested strategy is then supported by a numerical simulation.},

  abstract        = {This paper addresses the affine formation maneuver control of multi-agent systems with triple-integrator dynamics for both continuous-time and sampled-data settings. In affine formation control, the agents are supposed to form a desired geometric pattern and simultaneously achieve required maneuvers, such as rotation, scaling and translation. In existing literature, it is understood that this can be achieved for systems with double-integrator dynamics where the inter-agent communications occur continuously in time. However, agents may only be able to communicate in periodic time intervals and a broad range of systems have complex dynamics requiring higher-order dynamics in some practical situations. In this paper, we propose novel maneuver control laws using triple-integrator dynamics. The proposed approach is based on stress matrix, which allows the communication graph weights to be positive or negative, and it can be considered as a generalized Laplacian matrix of a graph. Under the proposed control laws, the group of agents are able to track time-varying targets that are affine transformations of a given nominal formation, and the desired formation maneuvers are only known by the leaders.},

The first leader will decide the whole formation's maneuver parameters, and the second leader group will keep the desired relative positions with respect to the first leader. The followers aim at moving to the desired positions affinely localized by the leaders. The main feature of this two-layered leader-follower strategy is that the information interaction from the first leader to the second leader group can be realized via wireless communication, and only the measurements of local relative position and its finite-order time-derivatives are needed for the followers. To achieve the control objective under the given constraints, the distributed control algorithms are designed for the second leader group and followers, in which the backstepping, distributed estimation, $PD^m$, and adaptive gain design techniques are employed. Finally, a simulation example with obstacle avoidance is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms.},

This paper proposes a novel affine formation maneuver control approach to achieve the two subtasks simultaneously.

The proposed control laws can track any target formation that is a time-varying affine transformation of a nominal configuration.

The desired formation maneuvers are only known by a small number of agents called leaders, and the rest of the agents called followers only need to follow the leaders.

  abstract  = {In this article, the specified-time affine formation maneuver control (AFMC) problem is studied with a leader–follower structure over a directed communication network. First, by means of Pontraygin's maximum principle and motion-planning techniques, a specified-time AFMC algorithm is designed for the second-integrator systems with dynamic leaders, which can lead the followers to achieve the desired affine formation at a specified settling time according to mission requirements and environmental constraints. Furthermore, the specified-time AFMC problem without velocity measurement is studied. The global convergence and stability of the closed-loop system with proposed control algorithms are analyzed. Compared with the existing finite-time AFMC algorithms, a prominent advantage of the proposed specified-time algorithms is that the convergence moment of AFMC can be accurately scheduled and appointed in advance. Finally, an example is simulated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Under a premise of universal rigidity, the affine formation control method based on stress matrix can solve the formation maneuvering problem well. However, a failure of the agent in the system can easily destroy this condition of rigidity. Consequently, a fault-tolerant affine formation control problem for multi-agent systems (MASs) with partial loss-of-effectiveness (PLOE) and bias faults is investigated. In this paper, a neural network-based hierarchical fault-tolerant affine formation (NN-HFAF) control strategy is proposed for heterogeneous nonlinear MASs. Firstly, some virtual systems are built as a link between leaders and followers. The virtual systems affinely locate their target positions in the formation maneuvers through the real-time positions of leaders. Then, an adaptive fault-tolerant control algorithm is designed for followers to tracking the virtual systems. It can effectively prevents the impact of a few agent failures from spreading to the whole network. And the system dynamics of agents in the network are considered to be heterogeneous. Moreover, radial basis function neural networks (RBF-NNs) are introduced to approximate the nonlinear functions of dynamic systems, the computational burden is reduced by adopting the single parameter learning mechanism. Finally, the numerical simulations are given to verify the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {This paper studies the problem of topology design and leader selection to activate affine formation control schemes. The affine formation control enjoys a distinguishing feature from other control methods in that the whole formation can be dynamically maneuvered by controlling a small number of agents called leaders. This relies on the stress matrix which defines the inter-agent communication/sensing topology determining the dynamic performance for an autonomous system. In the first step, a topology design algorithm based on mixed integer semi-definite programming (MISDP) is proposed to obtain the stress matrix with low communication cost, fast convergence speed and high tolerance to time-delay. Secondly, the proposed leader selection algorithm focuses on two objectives of practical significance: convergence speed and control energy, which are tailored to two optimization problems based on MISDP. At last, the collective agents are driven to the target formation via their local interactions and leaders’ external control inputs. The effectiveness of the overall framework is validated by both simulations and physical experiments.},
